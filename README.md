Welcome to MIT 18.06: Linear Algebra!course information, materials, and links are recorded below. You can dive in right away by reading this [introduction](https://github.com/mitmath/1806/blob/master/notes/Introduction%20to%20Linear%20Algebra%206th%20edition%20and%20A%20%3D%20CR_04.pdf) to the course by Professor Strang.

Course Description: *Basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra, emphasizing topics useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, singular value decomposition, and positive definite matrices. Applications to least-squares approximations, stability of differential equations, networks, Fourier transforms, and Markov processes. Uses linear algebra software. Compared with 18.700, more emphasis on matrix algorithms and many applications.*

**Instructors**: [Prof. Gilbert Strang](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/) and [Dr. Andrew Horning](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2334).  

**Textbook**: [Introduction to Linear Algebra: 6th Edition](http://eduapps.mit.edu/textbook/books.html?Term=2023SP&Subject=18.06). Professor Strang will explain more about this new 6th edition in class (it is not yet on Amazon). It now ends with two chapters on deep learning. Professor Strang plans to make the textbook available for students to purchase at a discount. Here again is a link to the [preface and contents](https://github.com/mitmath/1806/blob/master/notes/Introduction%20to%20Linear%20Algebra%206th%20edition%20and%20A%20%3D%20CR_04.pdf).
